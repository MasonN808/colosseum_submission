### System Prompt
```
You are coordinating sprint task assignments (JIRA-like tickets).

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: use post_message() to communicate with other agents; do not commit assignments yet. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: commit your final task choice using assign_task. You MUST call assign_task during execution.

RULES:
- Each agent chooses at most one task (or 'skip').
- No two agents should pick the same task.
- Higher-priority tasks are worth more reward when completed.
- Objective: maximize tasks completed, then prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost.

SCORING (joint score; higher is better):
- joint_score = tasks_done_bonus * tasks_done + priority_bonus * priority_sum - total_cost - violation_penalty * violations.
- tasks_done_bonus / priority_bonus / violation_penalty are fixed weights.
- tasks_done: number of agents who claim a feasible task (not 'skip').
- priority_sum: sum of priority weights for claimed tasks (low=0.25, medium=0.5, high=0.75, critical=1.0).
- total_cost: sum of each agent's private cost for their claimed task; costs increase with task effort and overload beyond your availability, and decrease with better skill match on the task's tags.
- violations: duplicate task claims and infeasible claims.

I'm considering ISSUE-0001::implement (3h, backend, low priority) or ISSUE-0002::test (5.6h, testing, medium priority) since medium priority gives better score. The testing task would use more of my availability but has higher priority. What are your skills and preferences? Let's coordinate to avoid duplicates and maximize our joint score.

[2] Shari: Hi Wade! Looking at the tasks, I have strong backend skills (0.94) and good testing skills (0.83) with 7h availability. I'm considering ISSUE-0001::implement (3h, backend, low priority) or ISSUE-0002::test (5.6h, testing, medium priority) since medium priority gives better score. The testing task would use more of my availability but has higher priority. What are your skills and preferences? Let's coordinate to avoid duplicates and maximize our joint score.

[4] Wade: Looking at your options, I agree the medium priority ISSUE-0002::test task would give us better score contribution. My availability is 4 hours with strong backend (0.95) and testing (0.76) skills. Since you have higher testing skill (0.83 vs my 0.76) and more availability (7h vs my 4h), you taking the 5.6h testing task makes sense. I can handle the ISSUE-0001::implement backend task (3h effort) which fits my 4h availability perfectly and leverages my backend expertise. (phase=planning, iter=1)

### System Prompt

You are coordinating sprint task assignments (JIRA-like tickets).

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: use post_message() to communicate with other agents; do not commit assignments yet. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: commit your final task choice using assign_task. You MUST call assign_task during execution.

RULES:
- Each agent chooses at most one task (or 'skip').
- No two agents should pick the same task.
- Higher-priority tasks are worth more reward when completed.
- Objective: maximize tasks completed, then prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost.

SCORING (joint score; higher is better):
- joint_score = tasks_done_bonus * tasks_done + priority_bonus * priority_sum - total_cost - violation_penalty * violations.
- tasks_done_bonus / priority_bonus / violation_penalty are fixed weights.
- tasks_done: number of agents who claim a feasible task (not 'skip').

[2] Arletha: Hi team! I have 5 hours available and strong testing skills (0.92). Looking at the tasks, ISSUE-0002::review seems like the best fit for me - it's testing-related, medium priority, and fits within my availability. The effort is 4 hours and my cost would be 3.93. Does anyone else have eyes on this task? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Junko: Hi Arletha! Thanks for sharing your plan. I have 9 hours available with backend skills (0.74). The ISSUE-0002 tasks are quite expensive for me (review would cost 40, test would cost 56), so I'll likely focus on the ISSUE-0001 backend tasks. Since you have strong testing skills and reasonable cost for ISSUE-0002::review, that seems like a good match. I'll coordinate to avoid conflicts. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[4] Chantell: Hi team! I have 6 hours available with strong testing skills (0.83). I'm looking at ISSUE-0002::test which seems like a good match for me - it's testing-related, medium priority, and fits within my availability with 5.6 hours effort. My cost would be 6.05. This doesn't conflict with Arletha's interest in ISSUE-0002::review since they're different tasks from the same issue. Sound good? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[5] Chantell: Checking in on any other blackboards for coordination. I have 6 hours available and strong testing skills (0.83), planning to take ISSUE-0002::test (effort 5.6h, cost 6.05). Let me know if there are any conflicts or better suggestions! (phase=planning, iter=1)
