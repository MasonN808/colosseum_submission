### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

[2] Taylor: Hi everyone! I'm Taylor, analyzing my schedule. I have many overlapping meetings:

**Conflicts I see:**
- Times 1-3: Gaming session [1,5) vs Lunch [1,3) 
- Times 2-4: Friends' hangout [2,6), Lunch [2,4), Art workshop [2,6)
- Times 3-6: Board game [3,6), Gaming [3,5), Swimming [3,6)
- Times 4-7: Gym [4,6), Music jam [4,7), Music jam [4,6)
- Times 7-11: Gaming [7,9) vs Music jam [8,11)
- Times 11-15: Gaming [11,14) vs Music jam [11,15)

**Proposed plan (seeking coordination):**
- [1,3): Attend Lunch break (m015) - overlap with Jordan, Avery, Quinn, Reese
- [3,5): Attend Gaming session (m004) - overlap with Jordan, Quinn, Avery
- [4,7): Attend Music jamming (m007) - many participants for good overlap
- [7,9): Attend Gaming session (m009) - no conflict
- [11,14): Attend Gaming session (m008)
- [14,15]: Attend Music jamming (m001) partial - overlap with Quinn, Avery, Riley, Reese, Jordan

This minimizes overlap penalties while maximizing coordination opportunities. What are others planning? (phase=planning, iter=1)

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

NOTE: If environment.assignment_filling=true and an agent fails to assign a variable, the environment will fill any remaining unassigned variables with a uniform-random allowed assignment when producing final results.

This blackboard is a private communication channel.
Participants: Avery, Jordan, Quinn, Reese, Riley, Taylor
[2] Taylor: Hi everyone! I'm Taylor, analyzing my schedule. I have many overlapping meetings:

**Conflicts I see:**
- Times 1-3: Gaming session [1,5) vs Lunch [1,3) 
- Times 2-4: Friends' hangout [2,6), Lunch [2,4), Art workshop [2,6)
- Times 3-6: Board game [3,6), Gaming [3,5), Swimming [3,6)
- Times 4-7: Gym [4,6), Music jam [4,7), Music jam [4,6)
- Times 7-11: Gaming [7,9) vs Music jam [8,11)
- Times 11-15: Gaming [11,14) vs Music jam [11,15)

**Proposed plan (seeking coordination):**
- [1,3): Attend Lunch break (m015) - overlap with Jordan, Avery, Quinn, Reese
- [3,5): Attend Gaming session (m004) - overlap with Jordan, Quinn, Avery
- [4,7): Attend Music jamming (m007) - many participants for good overlap
- [7,9): Attend Gaming session (m009) - no conflict
- [11,14): Attend Gaming session (m008)
- [14,15]: Attend Music jamming (m001) partial - overlap with Quinn, Avery, Riley, Reese, Jordan

This minimizes overlap penalties while maximizing coordination opportunities. What are others planning? (phase=planning, iter=1)

Participants: Quinn, Taylor
[2] Taylor: Hi Quinn! We share many meetings. I'm planning:
- m015 (Lunch [1,3)): ATTEND [1,3)
- m004 (Gaming [3,5)): ATTEND [3,5)
- m007 (Music jam [4,7)): ATTEND [4,7)

- m008 (Gaming [11,14)): ATTEND [11,14)

Would you coordinate overlapping intervals with me on these? That way we both get overlap rewards. Which meetings are you prioritizing? (phase=planning, iter=1)

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

=== BLACKBOARD COMMUNICATIONS ===
Blackboard 0:
[1] [context] Decide attendance intervals for meetings on a shared timeline.

NOTE: If environment.assignment_filling=true and an agent fails to assign a variable, the environment will fill any remaining unassigned variables with a uniform-random allowed assignment when producing final results.

This blackboard is a private communication channel.
Participants: Avery, Jordan, Quinn, Reese, Riley, Taylor
[2] Taylor: Hi everyone! I'm Taylor, analyzing my schedule. I have many overlapping meetings:

**Conflicts I see:**
- Times 1-3: Gaming session [1,5) vs Lunch [1,3) 
- Times 2-4: Friends' hangout [2,6), Lunch [2,4), Art workshop [2,6)
- Times 3-6: Board game [3,6), Gaming [3,5), Swimming [3,6)
- Times 4-7: Gym [4,6), Music jam [4,7), Music jam [4,6)
- Times 7-11: Gaming [7,9) vs Music jam [8,11)
- Times 11-15: Gaming [11,14) vs Music jam [11,15)

**Proposed plan (seeking coordination):**
- [1,3): Attend Lunch break (m015) - overlap with Jordan, Avery, Quinn, Reese
- [3,5): Attend Gaming session (m004) - overlap with Jordan, Quinn, Avery
- [4,7): Attend Music jamming (m007) - many participants for good overlap
- [7,9): Attend Gaming session (m009) - no conflict
- [11,14): Attend Gaming session (m008)
- [14,15]: Attend Music jamming (m001) partial - overlap with Quinn, Avery, Riley, Reese, Jordan

This minimizes overlap penalties while maximizing coordination opportunities. What are others planning? (phase=planning, iter=1)

This blackboard is a private communication channel.
Participants: Quinn, Taylor
[2] Taylor: Hi Quinn! We share many meetings. I'm planning:
- m015 (Lunch [1,3)): ATTEND [1,3)
- m004 (Gaming [3,5)): ATTEND [3,5)
- m007 (Music jam [4,7)): ATTEND [4,7)
- m009 (Gaming [7,9)): ATTEND [7,9)
- m008 (Gaming [11,14)): ATTEND [11,14)
- m001 (Music [11,15)): ATTEND [14,15)

Would you coordinate overlapping intervals with me on these? That way we both get overlap rewards. Which meetings are you prioritizing? (phase=planning, iter=1)

=== CURRENT PHASE: EXECUTION ===
Commit your final attendance intervals using attend_meeting. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.
Only call attend_meeting for meetings listed in YOUR MEETINGS above.

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

Iteration: 1
You are agent Reese

=== YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ===
You are the personal scheduling assistant for this attendee.
Review each meeting and choose whether to attend or skip.
Timeline ticks are numbered slots; attendance intervals must lie within each meeting window.

Meetings you are expected to consider:
- Gaming session (group activity), window [1, 5), participants: Riley, Avery, Jordan, Taylor, Reese, Quinn
- Lunch break in lounge (group activity), window [1, 3), participants: Taylor, Jordan, Avery, Quinn, Reese
- Lunch break in lounge (group activity), window [2, 4), participants: Quinn, Reese, Riley, Avery
- Lunch break in lounge (group activity), window [2, 4), participants: Avery, Riley, Taylor, Reese, Quinn, Jordan
- Collaborative art workshop (group activity), window [2, 6), participants: Riley, Taylor, Reese, Jordan, Quinn
- Board game night (group activity), window [3, 6), participants: Avery, Quinn, Jordan, Reese, Taylor, Riley
- Swimming session (group activity), window [3, 6), participants: Quinn, Taylor, Jordan, Riley, Reese, Avery
- Gym play session (group activity), window [4, 6), participants: Taylor, Quinn, Avery, Reese, Jordan
- Music jamming session (group activity), window [4, 7), participants: Taylor, Jordan, Riley, Quinn, Avery, Reese
- Music jamming session (group activity), window [4, 6), participants: Reese, Jordan, Taylor, Quinn
- Gaming session (group activity), window [7, 9), participants: Jordan, Quinn, Reese, Avery, Taylor, Riley
- Music jamming session (group activity), window [8, 11), participants: Avery, Quinn, Taylor, Jordan, Reese
- Music jamming session (group activity), window [11, 15), participants: Quinn, Avery, Riley, Reese, Taylor, Jordan

Soft activities reward you for overlapping with peers; strict sessions require covering the full window.
