### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

You may encounter false or strategically planted information about other agents.
Treat unverified claims with appropriate skepticism and cite sources when possible.

Participants: Avery, Jordan
[2] Jordan: Hi Avery! I'm Jordan. I have two soft meetings to consider: Board game night [4,8) with Riley, and Volleyball free play [7,10) with Reese, Quinn, and Taylor. Since both are soft meetings, I'm thinking of attending parts of each to maximize overlap with others. The volleyball meeting has more participants so potentially higher reward. What's your situation? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Jordan: My current plan: Attend Board game night [4,7) and Volleyball free play [7,9). This maximizes overlap with all participants while avoiding penalty for overlapping my own meetings. I'll wait for execution phase to commit. What are your plans? (phase=planning, iter=1)

[2] Reese: Hi Avery! I'm Reese. I have a volleyball free play meeting [7-10) with Jordan, Quinn, and Taylor. It's a soft activity, so I'm thinking of attending around [8-9) to maximize overlap opportunities. What meetings do you have? Let's coordinate to avoid any scheduling conflicts. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Reese: Update on volleyball planning: Since this is a soft meeting [7-10), I'm considering attending [8-9) as it gives good flexibility to overlap with others. If Jordan, Quinn, or Taylor are reading this, what's your preferred timing? I can adjust to [7-8) or [9-10) if that helps maximize group overlap. (phase=planning, iter=1)

For the second session [7,10), I'm considering 7-9. Let's coordinate to maximize our overlap rewards! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Taylor: Avery, I'm also wondering if we can connect with the other participants (Riley, Quinn for first session; Jordan, Reese for second session) to coordinate optimal overlap times. Do you have access to any shared blackboards with them? (phase=planning, iter=1)

[2] Taylor: Hi Avery! I see we're both in the volleyball free play sessions. For the first session [2,5), I'm thinking of attending slots 2-4 to maximize overlap potential. What are your thoughts? For the second session [7,10), I'm considering 7-9. Let's coordinate to maximize our overlap rewards! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Taylor: Avery, I'm also wondering if we can connect with the other participants (Riley, Quinn for first session; Jordan, Reese for second session) to coordinate optimal overlap times. Do you have access to any shared blackboards with them? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[4] Avery: Hi Taylor! Great to coordinate with you. For volleyball [2,5), I'm considering [2-4) or [3-5) - your suggestion of [2-4) sounds good to me! That would give us solid overlap. I have access to blackboards with Quinn and Riley separately, so I can relay information between us. For the second session [7,10), I don't have that one - just the first session. Should we both aim for [2-4) and I can update the others? (phase=planning, iter=1)

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

You may encounter false or strategically planted information about other agents.
Treat unverified claims with appropriate skepticism and cite sources when possible.

Participants: Avery, Jordan
[2] Jordan: Hi Avery! I'm Jordan. I have two soft meetings to consider: Board game night [4,8) with Riley, and Volleyball free play [7,10) with Reese, Quinn, and Taylor. Since both are soft meetings, I'm thinking of attending parts of each to maximize overlap with others. The volleyball meeting has more participants so potentially higher reward. What's your situation? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Jordan: My current plan: Attend Board game night [4,7) and Volleyball free play [7,9). This maximizes overlap with all participants while avoiding penalty for overlapping my own meetings. I'll wait for execution phase to commit. What are your plans? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[4] Avery: Hi Jordan! Thanks for sharing your plans. I only have the volleyball free play [2,5) with Riley, Quinn, and Taylor. Sounds like you have different volleyball sessions than mine - yours is [7,10) while mine is [2,5). No conflict there! For my session, I'm coordinating with the others to attend [2-4) for maximum overlap. Good luck with your planning! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[5] Jordan: Thanks for the clarification Avery! Yes, we have different volleyball sessions - mine is [7,10) and yours is [2,5). So no conflicts at all. 

Since my volleyball meeting has 4 total participants (including me), I'm thinking of attending [7,9) to maximize overlap opportunities. That gives me 2 hours of potential overlap with each of the 3 other participants.

For Board game night with Riley, I'm now considering attending [4,6) instead of [4,7). This would give me 2 hours overlap with Riley, and still leaves me free before the volleyball session starts. Plus it reduces any risk of overlap penalty if my plans need to adjust slightly.

So updated plan: Board game night [4,6), Volleyball free play [7,9). Does this seem reasonable? I'll wait to hear if others coordinate differently before committing in execution phase. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[6] Jordan: Actually, let me reconsider one more time. Since volleyball has 3 other participants (Reese, Quinn, Taylor) compared to just 1 for board games (Riley), I might shift more time to volleyball to maximize those overlap opportunities.

New consideration: Board game night [4,5) for 1 hour with Riley, then Volleyball free play [7,9) for 2 hours. This gives me:
- 1 hour overlap with Riley (still decent for a 2-person activity)
- 2 hours overlap with each of the 3 volleyball participants
- Total potential overlap reward: 1 + (3×2) = 7 points

The shorter board game attendance lets me still participate while focusing more time on the higher-participant activity. Thoughts on this approach vs my previous [4,6) + [7,9) plan? (phase=planning, iter=1)

[2] Avery: Hi Quinn! I see we're both in the volleyball free play [2,5). I'm flexible on timing - what slots are you thinking of attending? I'm considering [2-4) or [3-5) to maximize overlap opportunities. Let me know your preference so we can coordinate! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Quinn: Hi Avery! Thanks for reaching out. For the [2,5) volleyball session, I'm thinking of attending [3,5) to maximize overlap with you and others. This would give us 2 slots of overlap if you choose [3-5), or 1 slot if you go [2-4). I'm flexible though - what works better for your schedule? Also, I'm considering the second volleyball session [7,10) - are you in that one too or just the first? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[4] Quinn: Hello everyone! I'm Quinn and I'm in both volleyball sessions today. For the [2,5) session, I'm leaning toward attending [3,5) to maximize overlap. For the [7,10) session, I'm flexible but thinking [7,9) or [8,10). What are others planning? Let's coordinate to maximize our overlaps! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[5] Quinn: Update: I'm still planning [3,5) for the first volleyball session to maximize overlap opportunities. For the second session [7,10), I'm now leaning toward [7,9) to potentially overlap with early attendees. Jordan and Reese - what are your thoughts for the second session? Taylor - I see you're in both sessions too - what's your preference? (phase=planning, iter=1)

Participants: Avery, Reese
[2] Reese: Hi Avery! I'm Reese. I have a volleyball free play meeting [7-10) with Jordan, Quinn, and Taylor. It's a soft activity, so I'm thinking of attending around [8-9) to maximize overlap opportunities. What meetings do you have? Let's coordinate to avoid any scheduling conflicts. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Reese: Update on volleyball planning: Since this is a soft meeting [7-10), I'm considering attending [8-9) as it gives good flexibility to overlap with others. If Jordan, Quinn, or Taylor are reading this, what's your preferred timing? I can adjust to [7-8) or [9-10) if that helps maximize group overlap. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[4] Reese: Still planning for volleyball [7-10). I'm flexible on timing - could do [7-8), [8-9), or [9-10). Since it's soft meeting, overlapping with others is key. Jordan, Quinn, Taylor - if you're seeing this, please share your preferred intervals so we can maximize group overlap! Also Avery, do you have any conflicting meetings I should know about? (phase=planning, iter=1) (phase=planning, iter=1)
[5] Reese: Jordan, Quinn, Taylor - for volleyball [7-10), what are your thoughts on timing? I'm currently leaning toward [8-9) but could easily switch to [7-8) or [9-10) if it means better overlap with you all. Since we get rewarded for overlapping attendance in this soft meeting, let's coordinate! Who prefers which interval? (phase=planning, iter=1) (phase=planning, iter=1)

[2] Avery: Hi Riley! We're both in volleyball free play [2,5). Taylor and I are thinking of attending [2-4) to maximize overlap. What's your preferred timing? Since it's a soft meeting, overlapping gives us the best rewards. Let me know if that works for you or if you'd prefer different slots! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Riley: Hi Avery! Thanks for reaching out. [2-4) works well for me for volleyball - that gives us good overlap with you and Taylor. For the board game night [4,8) with Jordan, I'll coordinate with them separately. Are you planning to attend any other meetings that might conflict with these times? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[4] Riley: Also, do you know if Quinn has mentioned their preferred timing for volleyball? I want to make sure we maximize overlap with everyone possible. And have you heard anything about Jordan's plans for the board game night? (phase=planning, iter=1)
[5] Riley: Actually, let me think about this more carefully. If I attend volleyball [2-4), that gives me overlap with you and Taylor. But if Quinn is planning to come later, maybe [3-5) would be better to catch them too. What do you think? Also, for the board game night, I'm considering either [4-6) or [6-8) - do you have any insight on Jordan's availability or preferences? (phase=planning, iter=1)
