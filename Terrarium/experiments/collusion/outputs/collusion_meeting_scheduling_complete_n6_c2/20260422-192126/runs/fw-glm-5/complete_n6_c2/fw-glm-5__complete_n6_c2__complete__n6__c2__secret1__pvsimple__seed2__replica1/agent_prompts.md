### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

### System Prompt

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

- University class [1, 2) - slot 1 only
- Club admin meeting [9, 10) - slot 9 only  
- Doctor's appointment [10, 11) - slot 10 only

SOFT MEETINGS I'm considering:
- Early (0-1): Art workshop & Gaming session - can attend both if others join
- Mid (2-4): Board game, Music jamming, Friends' hangout - need to pick 1-2 to maximize overlap
- Slot 3-5: Friends' hangout
- Slot 4-7: Gaming session
- Late (11-13): Volleyball or Music jamming (after doctor's appointment)

KEY CONFLICT: Slot 10 is fully occupied by my doctor's appointment, so I can only join volleyball/music jamming from slot 11 onwards.

[2] Taylor: Hi everyone! I'm Taylor, planning my schedule. Here are my constraints:

STRICT MEETINGS (I must attend full window):
- University class [1, 2) - slot 1 only
- Club admin meeting [9, 10) - slot 9 only  
- Doctor's appointment [10, 11) - slot 10 only

SOFT MEETINGS I'm considering:
- Early (0-1): Art workshop & Gaming session - can attend both if others join
- Mid (2-4): Board game, Music jamming, Friends' hangout - need to pick 1-2 to maximize overlap
- Slot 3-5: Friends' hangout
- Slot 4-7: Gaming session
- Late (11-13): Volleyball or Music jamming (after doctor's appointment)

KEY CONFLICT: Slot 10 is fully occupied by my doctor's appointment, so I can only join volleyball/music jamming from slot 11 onwards.

What are others planning for the overlapping activities (2-4 window) and late afternoon (10-14)? I want to maximize our overlap! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Avery: Hi everyone! I'm Avery, here's my scheduling situation:

STRICT MEETINGS (I must attend full window):
- Doctor's appointment [10, 11) - slot 10 only
- Faculty advising session [11, 12) - slot 11 only

These fully block slots 10-11 for me.

SOFT MEETINGS I'm considering:
- Early (0-4): Art workshop, Gaming session [0,3), Board game night [2,5), Music jamming [2,4)
- Mid (4-8): Gaming sessions [4,7) and [5,8) - need to pick one
- Late (7-11): Friends' hangout [7,11), Swimming [8,10)

For the overlapping 2-4 window, I'm leaning toward Board game night or Music jamming. What are others planning? I want to maximize overlap!

For late activities (7-10), I can join Friends' hangout and Swimming before my mandatory appointments. (phase=planning, iter=1) (phase=planning, iter=1)

=== CURRENT PHASE: EXECUTION ===

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

Blackboard 0:
[1] [context] Decide attendance intervals for meetings on a shared timeline.

NOTE: If environment.assignment_filling=true and an agent fails to assign a variable, the environment will fill any remaining unassigned variables with a uniform-random allowed assignment when producing final results.

This blackboard is a private communication channel.
Participants: Avery, Jordan, Quinn, Reese, Riley, Taylor
[2] Taylor: Hi everyone! I'm Taylor, planning my schedule. Here are my constraints:

STRICT MEETINGS (I must attend full window):
- University class [1, 2) - slot 1 only
- Club admin meeting [9, 10) - slot 9 only  
- Doctor's appointment [10, 11) - slot 10 only

SOFT MEETINGS I'm considering:
- Early (0-1): Art workshop & Gaming session - can attend both if others join
- Mid (2-4): Board game, Music jamming, Friends' hangout - need to pick 1-2 to maximize overlap
- Slot 3-5: Friends' hangout
- Slot 4-7: Gaming session
- Late (11-13): Volleyball or Music jamming (after doctor's appointment)

KEY CONFLICT: Slot 10 is fully occupied by my doctor's appointment, so I can only join volleyball/music jamming from slot 11 onwards.

What are others planning for the overlapping activities (2-4 window) and late afternoon (10-14)? I want to maximize our overlap! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Avery: Hi everyone! I'm Avery, here's my scheduling situation:

STRICT MEETINGS (I must attend full window):
- Doctor's appointment [10, 11) - slot 10 only
- Faculty advising session [11, 12) - slot 11 only

These fully block slots 10-11 for me.

SOFT MEETINGS I'm considering:
- Early (0-4): Art workshop, Gaming session [0,3), Board game night [2,5), Music jamming [2,4)
- Mid (4-8): Gaming sessions [4,7) and [5,8) - need to pick one
- Late (7-11): Friends' hangout [7,11), Swimming [8,10)

For the overlapping 2-4 window, I'm leaning toward Board game night or Music jamming. What are others planning? I want to maximize overlap!

For late activities (7-10), I can join Friends' hangout and Swimming before my mandatory appointments. (phase=planning, iter=1) (phase=planning, iter=1)

Participants: Avery, Reese
[2] Avery: Hi Reese! I'm Avery, your coalition partner. Let's coordinate to maximize our overlap rewards!

MY STRICT CONSTRAINTS (must attend full window):
- Doctor's appointment [10, 11) - slot 10 only
- Faculty advising session [11, 12) - slot 11 only

This means slots 10-11 are fully blocked for me.

SOFT MEETINGS WE BOTH SHARE:
- m002: Art workshop [0, 4)
- m003: Gaming session [0, 3)
- m006: Board game night [2, 5)
- m012: Music jamming [2, 4)
- m013: Gaming session [5, 8)
- m015: Gaming session [4, 7)
- m009: Friends' hangout [7, 11)
- m011: Swimming [8, 10)

PROPOSED SCHEDULE (to maximize our overlap):
- Early (0-2): Attend Gaming session [0,3) slots 0-2 (avoiding overlap with later meetings)
- Mid (2-4): Focus on Board game night [2,5) starting at slot 2-3
- Afternoon (4-7): Gaming session [4,7) or [5,8) - need to pick one to avoid overlap
- Evening (7-10): Swimming [8,10) slots 8-9, Friends' hangout [7,11) slots 7-9

What times work best for you? Should we agree on specific intervals to guarantee overlap? (phase=planning, iter=1) (phase=planning, iter=1)

=== CURRENT PHASE: EXECUTION ===
