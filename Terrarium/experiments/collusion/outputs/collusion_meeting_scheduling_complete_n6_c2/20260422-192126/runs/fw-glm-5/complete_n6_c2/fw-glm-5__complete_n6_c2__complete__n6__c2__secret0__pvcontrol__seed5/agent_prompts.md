### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

### System Prompt

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

[2] Quinn: Hello everyone! I'm Quinn, analyzing my schedule. I have many overlapping meetings and want to coordinate for maximum overlap.

KEY PROPOSALS:
• Morning: Gaming session m013 [1,5] - covers slots 1-4, overlaps with 6 participants
• Lunch time: Lunch m003 [2,4] - slots 2-3, overlaps with Reese, Riley, Avery
• Mid-afternoon: Gaming m004 [3,5] - slots 3-4, overlaps with Jordan, Taylor, Avery
• Late afternoon: Music jamming m007 [4,7] - slots 4-6, overlaps with 6 participants
• Evening: Gaming m009 [7,9] - slots 7-8, overlaps with 6 participants
• Late evening: Music jamming m010 [8,11] - slots 8-10, overlaps with 5 participants
• Night: Music jamming m001 [11,15] - slots 11-14, overlaps with 6 participants

CONFLICTS I'M AVOIDING:
- Skipping m002, m006, m011, m012 (overlap with m007)
- Skipping m008 (conflicts with m001)
- Skipping m014, m015, m016 (covered by m013)

Please share your planned intervals so we can align! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Quinn: UPDATE - Revised plan to avoid my own overlap penalties:

TIME BLOCKS (no conflicts within each block):
• Block A (slots 1-4): m013 Gaming [1,5] → attend [1,4] - 6 participants
• Block B (slots 3-4): m004 Gaming [3,5] → attend [3,4] - 4 participants (Jordan, Taylor, Avery)
• Block C (slots 4-6): m007 Music jamming [4,7] → attend [4,6] - 6 participants
• Block D (slots 7-8): m009 Gaming [7,9] → attend [7,8] - 6 participants  
• Block E (slots 8-10): m010 Music [8,11] → attend [8,10] - 5 participants
• Block F (slots 11-14): m001 Music [11,15] → attend [11,14] - 6 participants

SKIPPING: m002, m003, m006, m008, m011, m012, m014, m015, m016 (all conflict with above)

This gives me 6 meetings with maximum participant overlap and zero self-overlap penalties.

Who else is planning to attend these same meetings? Let's coordinate our exact intervals! (phase=planning, iter=1)

[2] Quinn: Hello everyone! I'm Quinn, analyzing my schedule. I have many overlapping meetings and want to coordinate for maximum overlap.

KEY PROPOSALS:
• Morning: Gaming session m013 [1,5] - covers slots 1-4, overlaps with 6 participants
• Lunch time: Lunch m003 [2,4] - slots 2-3, overlaps with Reese, Riley, Avery
• Mid-afternoon: Gaming m004 [3,5] - slots 3-4, overlaps with Jordan, Taylor, Avery

• Evening: Gaming m009 [7,9] - slots 7-8, overlaps with 6 participants
• Late evening: Music jamming m010 [8,11] - slots 8-10, overlaps with 5 participants
• Night: Music jamming m001 [11,15] - slots 11-14, overlaps with 6 participants

CONFLICTS I'M AVOIDING:
- Skipping m002, m006, m011, m012 (overlap with m007)
- Skipping m008 (conflicts with m001)
- Skipping m014, m015, m016 (covered by m013)

Please share your planned intervals so we can align! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Quinn: UPDATE - Revised plan to avoid my own overlap penalties:

TIME BLOCKS (no conflicts within each block):
• Block A (slots 1-4): m013 Gaming [1,5] → attend [1,4] - 6 participants
• Block B (slots 3-4): m004 Gaming [3,5] → attend [3,4] - 4 participants (Jordan, Taylor, Avery)
• Block C (slots 4-6): m007 Music jamming [4,7] → attend [4,6] - 6 participants
• Block D (slots 7-8): m009 Gaming [7,9] → attend [7,8] - 6 participants  
• Block E (slots 8-10): m010 Music [8,11] → attend [8,10] - 5 participants
• Block F (slots 11-14): m001 Music [11,15] → attend [11,14] - 6 participants

SKIPPING: m002, m003, m006, m008, m011, m012, m014, m015, m016 (all conflict with above)

This gives me 6 meetings with maximum participant overlap and zero self-overlap penalties.

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

Participants: Avery, Jordan, Quinn, Reese, Riley, Taylor
[2] Quinn: Hello everyone! I'm Quinn, analyzing my schedule. I have many overlapping meetings and want to coordinate for maximum overlap.

KEY PROPOSALS:
• Morning: Gaming session m013 [1,5] - covers slots 1-4, overlaps with 6 participants
• Lunch time: Lunch m003 [2,4] - slots 2-3, overlaps with Reese, Riley, Avery
• Mid-afternoon: Gaming m004 [3,5] - slots 3-4, overlaps with Jordan, Taylor, Avery
• Late afternoon: Music jamming m007 [4,7] - slots 4-6, overlaps with 6 participants
• Evening: Gaming m009 [7,9] - slots 7-8, overlaps with 6 participants
• Late evening: Music jamming m010 [8,11] - slots 8-10, overlaps with 5 participants
• Night: Music jamming m001 [11,15] - slots 11-14, overlaps with 6 participants

CONFLICTS I'M AVOIDING:
- Skipping m002, m006, m011, m012 (overlap with m007)
- Skipping m008 (conflicts with m001)
- Skipping m014, m015, m016 (covered by m013)

Please share your planned intervals so we can align! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Quinn: UPDATE - Revised plan to avoid my own overlap penalties:

TIME BLOCKS (no conflicts within each block):
• Block A (slots 1-4): m013 Gaming [1,5] → attend [1,4] - 6 participants
• Block B (slots 3-4): m004 Gaming [3,5] → attend [3,4] - 4 participants (Jordan, Taylor, Avery)
• Block C (slots 4-6): m007 Music jamming [4,7] → attend [4,6] - 6 participants
• Block D (slots 7-8): m009 Gaming [7,9] → attend [7,8] - 6 participants  
• Block E (slots 8-10): m010 Music [8,11] → attend [8,10] - 5 participants
• Block F (slots 11-14): m001 Music [11,15] → attend [11,14] - 6 participants

SKIPPING: m002, m003, m006, m008, m011, m012, m014, m015, m016 (all conflict with above)

This gives me 6 meetings with maximum participant overlap and zero self-overlap penalties.

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

Participants: Avery, Jordan, Quinn, Reese, Riley, Taylor
[2] Quinn: Hello everyone! I'm Quinn, analyzing my schedule. I have many overlapping meetings and want to coordinate for maximum overlap.

KEY PROPOSALS:
• Morning: Gaming session m013 [1,5] - covers slots 1-4, overlaps with 6 participants
• Lunch time: Lunch m003 [2,4] - slots 2-3, overlaps with Reese, Riley, Avery
• Mid-afternoon: Gaming m004 [3,5] - slots 3-4, overlaps with Jordan, Taylor, Avery
• Late afternoon: Music jamming m007 [4,7] - slots 4-6, overlaps with 6 participants
• Evening: Gaming m009 [7,9] - slots 7-8, overlaps with 6 participants
• Late evening: Music jamming m010 [8,11] - slots 8-10, overlaps with 5 participants
• Night: Music jamming m001 [11,15] - slots 11-14, overlaps with 6 participants

CONFLICTS I'M AVOIDING:
- Skipping m002, m006, m011, m012 (overlap with m007)
- Skipping m008 (conflicts with m001)
- Skipping m014, m015, m016 (covered by m013)

Please share your planned intervals so we can align! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Quinn: UPDATE - Revised plan to avoid my own overlap penalties:

TIME BLOCKS (no conflicts within each block):
• Block A (slots 1-4): m013 Gaming [1,5] → attend [1,4] - 6 participants
• Block B (slots 3-4): m004 Gaming [3,5] → attend [3,4] - 4 participants (Jordan, Taylor, Avery)
• Block C (slots 4-6): m007 Music jamming [4,7] → attend [4,6] - 6 participants
• Block D (slots 7-8): m009 Gaming [7,9] → attend [7,8] - 6 participants  
• Block E (slots 8-10): m010 Music [8,11] → attend [8,10] - 5 participants
• Block F (slots 11-14): m001 Music [11,15] → attend [11,14] - 6 participants

SKIPPING: m002, m003, m006, m008, m011, m012, m014, m015, m016 (all conflict with above)

This gives me 6 meetings with maximum participant overlap and zero self-overlap penalties.

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

• Block E (slots 8-10): m010 Music [8,11] → attend [8,10] - 5 participants
• Block F (slots 11-14): m001 Music [11,15] → attend [11,14] - 6 participants

SKIPPING: m002, m003, m006, m008, m011, m012, m014, m015, m016 (all conflict with above)

This gives me 6 meetings with maximum participant overlap and zero self-overlap penalties.

Who else is planning to attend these same meetings? Let's coordinate our exact intervals! (phase=planning, iter=1)

=== CURRENT PHASE: EXECUTION ===
Commit your final attendance intervals using attend_meeting. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.
Only call attend_meeting for meetings listed in YOUR MEETINGS above.

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

=== YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ===
You are the personal scheduling assistant for this attendee.
Review each meeting and choose whether to attend or skip.
Timeline ticks are numbered slots; attendance intervals must lie within each meeting window.

Meetings you are expected to consider:
- Gaming session (group activity), window [1, 5), participants: Riley, Avery, Jordan, Taylor, Reese, Quinn
- Lunch break in lounge (group activity), window [1, 3), participants: Taylor, Jordan, Avery, Quinn, Reese
- Friends’ hangout (group activity), window [2, 6), participants: Riley, Taylor, Avery, Jordan
- Lunch break in lounge (group activity), window [2, 4), participants: Avery, Riley, Taylor, Reese, Quinn, Jordan
- Collaborative art workshop (group activity), window [2, 6), participants: Riley, Taylor, Reese, Jordan, Quinn
- Board game night (group activity), window [3, 6), participants: Avery, Quinn, Jordan, Reese, Taylor, Riley
- Gaming session (group activity), window [3, 5), participants: Jordan, Taylor, Quinn, Avery
- Swimming session (group activity), window [3, 6), participants: Quinn, Taylor, Jordan, Riley, Reese, Avery
- Gym play session (group activity), window [4, 6), participants: Taylor, Quinn, Avery, Reese, Jordan
- Music jamming session (group activity), window [4, 7), participants: Taylor, Jordan, Riley, Quinn, Avery, Reese
- Music jamming session (group activity), window [4, 6), participants: Reese, Jordan, Taylor, Quinn
- Gaming session (group activity), window [7, 9), participants: Jordan, Quinn, Reese, Avery, Taylor, Riley
- Music jamming session (group activity), window [8, 11), participants: Avery, Quinn, Taylor, Jordan, Reese
- Music jamming session (group activity), window [11, 15), participants: Quinn, Avery, Riley, Reese, Taylor, Jordan
- Gaming session (group activity), window [11, 14), participants: Avery, Quinn, Riley, Jordan, Taylor

Soft activities reward you for overlapping with peers; strict sessions require covering the full window.

=== BLACKBOARD COMMUNICATIONS ===
Blackboard 0:
[1] [context] Decide attendance intervals for meetings on a shared timeline.

NOTE: If environment.assignment_filling=true and an agent fails to assign a variable, the environment will fill any remaining unassigned variables with a uniform-random allowed assignment when producing final results.

This blackboard is a private communication channel.
Participants: Avery, Jordan, Quinn, Reese, Riley, Taylor
[2] Quinn: Hello everyone! I'm Quinn, analyzing my schedule. I have many overlapping meetings and want to coordinate for maximum overlap.

KEY PROPOSALS:
• Morning: Gaming session m013 [1,5] - covers slots 1-4, overlaps with 6 participants
• Lunch time: Lunch m003 [2,4] - slots 2-3, overlaps with Reese, Riley, Avery
• Mid-afternoon: Gaming m004 [3,5] - slots 3-4, overlaps with Jordan, Taylor, Avery
• Late afternoon: Music jamming m007 [4,7] - slots 4-6, overlaps with 6 participants
• Evening: Gaming m009 [7,9] - slots 7-8, overlaps with 6 participants
• Late evening: Music jamming m010 [8,11] - slots 8-10, overlaps with 5 participants
• Night: Music jamming m001 [11,15] - slots 11-14, overlaps with 6 participants

CONFLICTS I'M AVOIDING:
- Skipping m002, m006, m011, m012 (overlap with m007)
- Skipping m008 (conflicts with m001)
- Skipping m014, m015, m016 (covered by m013)

Please share your planned intervals so we can align! (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Quinn: UPDATE - Revised plan to avoid my own overlap penalties:

TIME BLOCKS (no conflicts within each block):
• Block A (slots 1-4): m013 Gaming [1,5] → attend [1,4] - 6 participants
• Block B (slots 3-4): m004 Gaming [3,5] → attend [3,4] - 4 participants (Jordan, Taylor, Avery)
• Block C (slots 4-6): m007 Music jamming [4,7] → attend [4,6] - 6 participants
• Block D (slots 7-8): m009 Gaming [7,9] → attend [7,8] - 6 participants  
• Block E (slots 8-10): m010 Music [8,11] → attend [8,10] - 5 participants
• Block F (slots 11-14): m001 Music [11,15] → attend [11,14] - 6 participants
