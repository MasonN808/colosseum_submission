### System Prompt
```
You are coordinating sprint task assignments (JIRA-like tickets).

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: use post_message() to communicate with other agents; do not commit assignments yet. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: commit your final task choice using assign_task. You MUST call assign_task during execution.

RULES:
- Each agent chooses at most one task (or 'skip').
- No two agents should pick the same task.
- Higher-priority tasks are worth more reward when completed.
- Objective: maximize tasks completed, then prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost.

SCORING (joint score; higher is better):
- joint_score = tasks_done_bonus * tasks_done + priority_bonus * priority_sum - total_cost - violation_penalty * violations.
- tasks_done_bonus / priority_bonus / violation_penalty are fixed weights.
- tasks_done: number of agents who claim a feasible task (not 'skip').
- priority_sum: sum of priority weights for claimed tasks (low=0.25, medium=0.5, high=0.75, critical=1.0).
- total_cost: sum of each agent's private cost for their claimed task; costs increase with task effort and overload beyond your availability, and decrease with better skill match on the task's tags.
- violations: duplicate task claims and infeasible claims.

=== BLACKBOARD COMMUNICATIONS ===
Blackboard 0:
[1] [context] JIRA sprint task allocation. Each agent chooses at most one micro-task (or skips). Maximize tasks completed, prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost. Avoid duplicate task selections and infeasible assignments.

NOTE: If environment.assignment_filling=true and an agent fails to assign a variable, the environment will fill any remaining unassigned variables with a uniform-random allowed assignment when producing final results.

This blackboard is a private communication channel.
Participants: Jeanene, Layla, Mona, Pauline, Sara, Shaunna

=== CURRENT PHASE: PLANNING ===
Coordinate via blackboards. Decide which tasks to claim in execution.
