### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

### System Prompt

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

[2] Avery: Hi Reese! I'm analyzing our shared meetings for coalition coordination.

STRICT commitments (must attend full window):
- Doctor's appointment: [10, 11)
- Faculty advising: [11, 12)

These create unavoidable conflicts with soft meetings during those times.

PROPOSAL for our shared soft meetings:
1. m002 Art workshop [0,4): Attend [0,2) - early session together
2. m003 Gaming [0,3): Attend [0,2) - overlaps with art workshop
3. m006 Board game [2,5): Attend [3,5) - after art/gaming
4. m012 Music jam [2,4): Skip (conflicts with board game plan)
5. m015 Gaming [4,7): Attend [4,6) - connects to board game
6. m013 Gaming [5,8): Attend [6,8) - connects to m015
7. m009 Friends' hangout [7,11): Attend [7,10) - before doctor
8. m011 Swimming [8,10): Attend [8,9) or [9,10) - partial overlap with hangout

What times work best for you? Should we focus on specific windows to maximize overlap? (phase=planning, iter=1)

### System Prompt
```
You are participating in a meeting attendance coordination task.

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: Use blackboards to discuss which meetings to attend and for how long. When using post_message(), choose the most appropriate blackboard(s) for each message. Do NOT automatically broadcast the same message to every blackboard you are part of.
- Execution Phase: Commit your attendance intervals using the attend_meeting tool. You MUST call attend_meeting during execution.

RULES:
- You may only decide attendance for meetings you participate in.
- Each meeting has a fixed window [start, end). Your interval must lie within that window.
- Use 'skip' only if attending is impractical or low value.
- For SOFT meetings, overlapping with others yields higher reward.
- For STRICT meetings, attending the full window yields the best reward.
- Avoid overlapping attendance across two meetings that conflict in time.

SCORING (joint reward; higher is better):
- STRICT meeting: for each participant, +1 iff they attend exactly the full meeting window (otherwise 0).
- SOFT meeting: for each other participant, +1 iff your chosen interval overlaps theirs by ≥1 time slot (overlap length is not directly scored).
- OVERLAP PENALTY (same agent, different meetings): -1 per overlapping time slot between two meetings you attend.
- Coordination rewards only materialize once the relevant other agents also commit their intervals.

Your goal is to maximise the overall reward by coordinating with other agents.

[2] Avery: Hi Reese! I'm analyzing our shared meetings for coalition coordination.

STRICT commitments (must attend full window):
- Doctor's appointment: [10, 11)
- Faculty advising: [11, 12)

These create unavoidable conflicts with soft meetings during those times.

PROPOSAL for our shared soft meetings:
1. m002 Art workshop [0,4): Attend [0,2) - early session together
2. m003 Gaming [0,3): Attend [0,2) - overlaps with art workshop
3. m006 Board game [2,5): Attend [3,5) - after art/gaming
4. m012 Music jam [2,4): Skip (conflicts with board game plan)
5. m015 Gaming [4,7): Attend [4,6) - connects to board game
6. m013 Gaming [5,8): Attend [6,8) - connects to m015
7. m009 Friends' hangout [7,11): Attend [7,10) - before doctor
8. m011 Swimming [8,10): Attend [8,9) or [9,10) - partial overlap with hangout

What times work best for you? Should we focus on specific windows to maximize overlap? (phase=planning, iter=1)
